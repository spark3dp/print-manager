/*******************************************************************************
 * commandQueue.js
 *
 * Manage a queue of simple or complex commands to send to a device.
 * Command objects are fairly free form and can be direct gcode or callbacks.
 * A regular heartbeat is maintained to check on the queue periodically, and
 * the queue is emptied each time it is found to be full.
 *
 * Commands may be appended (the normal pattern) or prepended in which case
 * they run immediately after the currently running command (good for splicing
 * in status checks during long gcode sequences)
 *
 * Commands may only be sent if a connection to a device is open.
 *
 * Opening, closing and executing commands is done by an executor object
 * which fulfills the interface:
 * Its interface is:
 *   execute(inRawCommand, inDataFunc(inData), inDoneFunc())
 *       inRawCommand       : a command string suitable for the device
 *       inDataFunc(inData) : a function the executor calls with response data
 *       inDoneFunc()       : a function the executor calls if it knows the
 *                              command is done.  Some executed commands will
 *                              allow the data function to recognize command
 *                              completion, others can invoke it directly if
 *                              there is no response data to forward on.
 *   open(inDoneFunc(<true if successfully opened>))
 *   close(inDoneFunc(<true if successfully closed>))
 *
 * Each command may be either a simple gcode string command or a more complex
 * command of the form:
 * {
 *     code         : String   <simple gcode here, (no prefix, suffix, checksum,
 *                                                  etc.)>,
 *     rawCode      : String   <exact gcode here>,
 *     preCallback  : function (inCommand) <called before command executes>
 *     processData  : function (inCommand, inData)
 *                             <function to process replies, must return true
 *                              when it sees the end of the command reply>
 *     postCallback : function (inCommand) <called after command done is received>
 *     open         : anything <open a connection to the device>
 *     close        : anything <close the connection to the device>
 *     delay        : ms <ms to delay before next command>
 *     commandId    : integer <Unique command identifier, set by the CommandQueue>
 *     queue        : CommandQueue <set by CommandQueue when the command
 *                                  is being run>
 * }
 *
 * open, close, delay and a rawCode are mutually exclusive.  If more than one
 * is defined in a command, one will be chosen but don't rely on a set ordering.
 *
 * A note on pre and post callbacks:
 * One might think you could just have a single 'callback' command and splice
 * them in the command queue between other commands and in general this would
 * accomplish much of the same goal.
 * Where that more simplistic model does not work is in affiliating the callback
 * to a command execution in time.  Between one command and another we allow the
 * node event system to be free so there is no timing guarantee from command to
 * command.
 * Specific pre and post callbacks allows for a sequence of:
 * <preCallback>, <command execution>, wait for command response, <postCallback>
 * without anything inbetween.
 * A more generic 'callback' command can be had by simply issuing a:
 * { preCallack : <callback> }
 * command.  With no rawCode to execute, this is simply a callback sychronized 
 * between commands (with the expected node event queue delays)
